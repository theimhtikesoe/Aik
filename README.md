AIK Photography Portfolio 📸

TL;DR: A premium, 3D interactive portfolio for AIK Photography. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and modern JS. No frameworks, just raw code and a heavy vibe.

This ain't just a static page; it's a digital canvas. This project was built to give the photographer AIK a unique web presence that matches his cinematic style. It merges a clean, "frosted glass" UI with a fully interactive 3D background from Spline.

(I recommend you record a 10-second GIF of the site (scrolling, interacting with the 3D model) and replace this image. A GIF hits way harder.)

✨ Core Features

Interactive 3D Background: The entire site floats on top of a live Spline scene. You can click, drag, and interact with the 3D model while navigating the content.

"Frosted Glass" UI: A clean, premium "glassmorphism" effect for all content panels, built with CSS backdrop-filter.

Smooth Scroll Animations: All content panels and the footer gracefully fade-in and slide-up on scroll. This is built with the native IntersectionObserver API for high performance.

Active Nav Highlighting: The navigation links ("About," "Projects") automatically detect which section is on-screen and highlight themselves.

Fully Responsive: Stacks clean. The desktop's 3-column layout seamlessly transitions to a single, focused column on tablet and mobile.

Developer Easter Egg: A professional "signature." Clicking the "AIK" logo in the nav triggers a frosted glass modal crediting the developer (you).

💻 Tech Stack

This project is a testament to the power of the modern web platform. No heavy frameworks or libraries needed.
